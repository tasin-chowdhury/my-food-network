            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <p>
                The most successful food and recipe websites are specialized. Theyâ€™ve chosen a niche. Rather than
                serving up mediocre content in numerous categories, let your audience feast on 1 or 2 niche categories
                catered by a master content chef. Just like a fine dining experience, when it comes to a successful food
                blog, quality over quantity always wins the day.
